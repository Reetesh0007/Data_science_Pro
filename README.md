# 2. Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into one of three species—setosa, versicolor, or virginica—based on the length and width of the sepals and petals.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

## Installation
To set up the project environment, run the following commands:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
